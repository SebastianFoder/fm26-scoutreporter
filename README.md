# FM26 Scout Reporter

A modern web app for importing **Football Manager 26** player CSV exports and turning them into a searchable, comparable scouting view with configurable:

- Attribute **weights** (profiles)
- Highlighted attributes (profiles)
- Attribute value bands / thresholds (profiles)
- Light/Dark themes
- Player comparison (gold/silver/bronze per attribute, relative to selected players)

- **Compare view** with:
  - Player selector (search + pagination)
  - Comparison table
  - Per-row medal ranking (gold/silver/bronze)
- **How to use** page with step-by-step exporter setup guide

## Releases

This project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automate versioning and GitHub Releases. Releases are triggered automatically when commits land on `master`.

Commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format so semantic-release can determine the next version:

| Prefix | Version bump |
|--------|-------------|
| `fix:` | Patch (0.0.x) |
| `feat:` | Minor (0.x.0) |
| `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | Major (x.0.0) |

Other prefixes like `chore:`, `docs:`, `ci:` do not trigger a release.

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
